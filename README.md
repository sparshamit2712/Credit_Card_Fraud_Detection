# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
We will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. As described in the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons. Nevertheless, we can still analyze some important aspects of the dataset.

Since the data is highly unbalanced i have used the average precession-recall method to find out the how the model is working.
After using different models including ensemble models and found out that the best suited model is the RandomForestClassifier.

I have used google colab because the dataset is quite bulky and required a lot of time for training the model.

All you have to do is download or copy the code and just change the path for dataset and run it on your machine.

The dataset is availabe on the following link-: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
